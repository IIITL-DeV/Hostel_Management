## Description
he Hostel Management system is developed for automating the activities of the hostel
The Software will be a great relief to the students,warden and the administration.This Software helps students in case of registration,complaints and outpasses.The Aim of Hostel Management system is to carry out the administrative activities in an efficient way. It will take the operations of the hostel to another level by providing faster access to data and allowing addition,updating and deletion in a systematic and reliable manner.Students no longer have to go through the administrative hassle for their needs related to Hostel or outpass.It will save the valuable time of the students, Warden and the Administration.

Why use Hostel Management System?
1. The existing system is highly manual involving a lot of paperwork and calculation and therefore maybe erroneous. This has led to inconsistency and inaccuracy in the maintenance of data.
2. The data which is stored on paper only,maybe lost, stolen or destroyed due to natural calamities like fire and water.
3. The existing system is sluggish and causes inconvenience to students and employees.
4. Due to manual nature itâ€™s difficult to delete, update, add or view the data.
5. Since the number of students may become large it becomes difficult to maintain a detailed record of each student.

Features that we Implemented in our Current Project:-
1. Hostel In-mate students can login using their institute email-id
2. Hostel in-mates can file complaints regarding problems they are facing the hostel and review the progress of them
3. The software is made transparent which is all the complaints filed can be re-viewed in a Complaint list.
4. Once a complaint has been resolved, the admin can toggle it as done and it would no longer display in the active complaints section.
5. OutPass Feature which enables the students who are leaving the hostel to seek permission from the Admin.
6. Forgot password feature which can become handy when the password is lost.
7. Students can update password whenever required.
